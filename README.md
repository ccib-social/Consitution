# Welcome from the Student Organizing Committee Chair
<br>
Dear fellow students,
<br>
The Student Organizing Committee (SOC) Executive Board would like to join the Graduate Program Director in welcoming you to a new academic year in the CCIB. I am excited to serve as the Chair of the SOC for this academic year alongside Vice-Chairs Sung Won Oh (Experimental) and Liam Sharp (Computational). As fellow graduate students, we would like to help you to get the most out of your time in the CCIB by fostering a welcoming, enjoyable, and productive environment for all students, both new and returning. The SOC supports CCIB students in several ways, including:
<br>
- Inviting and hosting the annual student-elected speaker for the CCIB seminar series
- Selecting and organizing student outings and social activities
- Leading discussions and choosing papers for CCIB Journal Club, a weekly forum to discuss scholarly articles
- Hearing student concerns and suggestions twice per semester at open committee meetings
- RepresentingtheCCIBstudentbodyintheGraduateSchoolbysittingontheGraduateStudent
Advisory Council
- Facilitating CCIB student involvement in community outreach activities, such as Rutgers Day and the Philadelphia Science Festival
- LiaisingbetweenstudentsandtheCCIBDirectorandGraduateProgramDirectoraboutstudent body concerns
<br>
The SOC was officially founded in 2018 by Daniel Russo to ensure the representation of the interest of the CCIB student body on campus. We encourage CCIB students to join the Committee to com- municate with us about concerns that they feel may need to be raised either within the Center or the Graduate School. Becoming a member of the SOC gives you a voice in the issues that the Board raises and events we plan. It also gives you voting privileges for the student speaker and executive board elections.
<br>
The Executive Board encourages questions and feedback to make sure we are genuinely acting in the interest of the CCIB student body at large. I am accessible (preferably) by Slack using @heather, or by e-mail at heather.ciallella@rutgers.edu. To address the whole SOC Executive Board, head over to the #ccib-soc Slack channel and use the tag @socboard.
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
